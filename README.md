# TelegramBot
This AI-based chatbot can not only answer user questions using natural language processing but also generate realistic images from user-provided text prompts using a powerful deep learning model. It combines a text chatbot with image generation using Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion model, allowing users to visualize their imagination â€” for example, by typing "a panda riding a bike" and instantly seeing the result.
